The first time you want to work on the project, clone the repository. You will need python installed to complete the next steps.
To run backend server:

1. (Highly recommended but not necessary) Create a virtual environment.
2. Install packages listed in requirements.txt (in the virtualenv if created)
3. To see the application in your browser (with minimal barebone front end) run (from eco-eco-app):

```
flask --app backend run
```
